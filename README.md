# **Vehicle Detection**
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This repository contains my implementation of the homonymous open source [project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection) part of the [Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](http://www.udacity.com/drive).

For a step by step walkthrough of the project see [here](https://iacopomc.github.io/projects/2020-08-10-vehicle-detection-project/)

Dependencies
---
To execute the pipeline, the following dependencies are necessary:

```python
```

Installation
---
Clone the Github Repository and run each cell contained in the Jupiter Notebook `vehicle_detection.ipynb`

```python
git clone https://github.com/IacopomC/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3
cd CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3
jupyter notebook behavioral_cloning.ipynb
```

Data
---

Here are the links to the labeled data for [vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles.zip) and [non-vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles.zip) examples to train the classifier. These example images come from a combination of the [GTI vehicle image database](http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html), the [KITTI vision benchmark suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/), and examples extracted from the project video itself.

To augment the training data you can take advantage of the recently released [Udacity labeled dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations).
